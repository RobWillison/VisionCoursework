\subsection{Normalised Correlation}

The normalised correlation is defined as shown in figure as $(x-m_x1)$ is simply
the vectorised template minus its mean this can be precalculated as it does not
change as the templed in convolved. The $(x-m_x1)^T(y-m_y1)$ can be expanded into
four seperate terms $x^Ty - m_x1^Ty - x^Tm_y + m_x^Tm_y$ each which can be computed
using a correlation. These four correlations are shown in figure ??, below.

\begin{figure}
MxY = filter2(templateMean, im);
XMy = filter2(template, imMean);
MxMy = filter2(templateMean, imMean);
XY = filter2(template, im);
\end{figure}

Once these four correlations are computed they can be combined to give the values
for the top of the normalised correlation equation. The next step is to divide
this by the standard deviation of the template and area of the image under the
template. The standard deviation of the template can be computed simply using
std().


\begin{figure}
$r=\frac{(x-m_x1)^T(y-m_y1)}{|x-m_x1||y-m_x1|}$
\end{figure}
