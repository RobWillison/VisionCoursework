\subsection{Normalised Correlation}

The normalised correlation is defined as shown in figure as $(x-m_x1)$ is simply
the vectorised template minus its mean this can be precalculated as it does not
change as the templed in convolved. The $(x-m_x1)^T(y-m_y1)$ can be expanded into
four seperate terms $x^Ty - m_x1^Ty - x^Tm_y + m_x^Tm_y$ each which can be computed
using a correlation. After this the result can be divided by $|x-m_x1||y-m_x1|$.


\begin{figure}
$r=\frac{(x-m_x1)^T(y-m_y1)}{|x-m_x1||y-m_x1|}$
\end{figure}
